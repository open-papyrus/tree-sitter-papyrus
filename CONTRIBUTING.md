## Committing

Before committing any changes, make sure to sign your commits using either [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification) (recommended) or [GPG](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification) commit signature verification. The master branch has branch protection rules in place and requires signed commits.
